<h2>The Perfect Sushi Rice Recipe</h2>

<p>Firstly, the term sushi rice is a misnomer as technically, the word sushi refers to the rice, not the final product. But for arguments sake we’re going to ignore that little tidbit. Sushi would not be sushi without great rice, and here we offer the secrets of our sushi rice recipe that never fails. Anyone can boil rice, but to make really good sushi you will need the right kind of rice, cooked the right way, and properly seasoned. So, you want to make perfect sushi rice every time? The first thing you need to know is the right kind of rice to use for sushi. The short-grain rice reserved for the task is often called sushi rice, and is available now in many markets, not just Japanese markets. Only this kind of rice has the right balance of starches (amylose and amylopectin) to allow the rice to stick together and keep the final product intact from plate to mouth. Try to eat medium or long-grain rice with chopsticks and you will understand what I mean. While there are many brands and types of short-grain rice, the most popular in terms of its high quality is Koshihikari rice (often called “Koshi rice”).</p>

<h2>Know Your Sushi Rice</h2>
<p>It is best to use the instructions on the package of rice when cooking it, but a general suggestion is to use equal parts rice and water. Prior to cooking, the rice should be rinsed in cold water until the water runs clear, a step now becoming less necessary as talc (used to prevent the rice from absorbing water and sticking together during storage) is slowly being replaced with another type of starch, which is fine to cook with. But you never know and the package won't tell you what the company used as a coating. A rice cooker will do a fine job, however if you do not have one you can use our fail safe pot rice recipe which has served many well in the past.</p>
