<p>Making traditional nigiri sushi (finger sushi) is actually quite simple. Follow these steps to make your very own!</p>
<ol>   
    <li>Moisten your hands. This is necessary any time you will be working with sushi rice to enable you to handle it without it sticking to your hands and making the task of shaping impossible.</li>
    <br>
    <li>2Take enough rice to slightly fill the palm of your hand (perhaps the size of a very small egg) when it is closed.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Form the rice into a thick rectangle with rounded edges approximately 2 inches long by 1 inch high and wide by pressing the sides. You may roll the rice around in your hand a bit but be careful not to press too hard as we do want to retain some of the air that has been incorporated into the rice into the final product. If you press too much it will be too dense and not have the right mouth feel.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Once you have the 'bed' shaped it is your choice as to whether you want to place a dab of wasabi on it before the neta (fish). If you are not a fan of wasabi you may omit this step. You should have your fish, or whichever topping you choose, prepared for placement on the rice. Fish should be cut against the grain in a relatively thin slice just large enough to ever so slightly drape over the edges of the rice bed. Traditionally, the neta is 2 inches long, 3/4 of an inch wide, and 1/8 of an inch thick. Of course it is certainly your choice if you would like your neta to be giant, however the traditional itamae always strive for balance when preparing sushi, which usually results in being conservative with fish. But you are home and if you feel like itâ€¦ go for it! Some restaurants have tried innovative cuts to make things interesting, but for the beginner, a simple rectangle of fish will suffice. Feel free to experiment as you become more comfortable. Once the fish is in place you will have made your first piece of nigiri sushi.</li>
